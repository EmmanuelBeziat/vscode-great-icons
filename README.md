> Wow, we reached 1.8 million downloads… You’ve made my little set one of the most used by VSC community (well, really far behind the first, but still!). Thanks for your support! You’re amazing. ♥

## How to use

After installation and activation, you should go in settings (`File` → `Preferences` on Windows, or `Code` → `Preferences` on OSX), choose `File Icon Theme`, and select `VSCode Great Icons`.
