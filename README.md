## How to use

After installation and activation, you should go in settings (`File` → `Preferences` → `File Icon Theme` on Windows, or `Code` → `Preferences`  → `File Icon Theme` on macOS), and select `VSCode Great Icons`.

## Want more?

I can add more icons if you need, [open a **new** issue](https://github.com/EmmanuelBeziat/vscode-great-icons/issues) to ask which extension you want.

## Do you work with angular?

Check out the [Simpler VSCode Icons](https://github.com/DavidBabel/vscode-simpler-icons) fork by **@DavidBabel**! Though it’s not been updated recently and might not be up to date, it has a lot of angular icons for various filetypes in angular projects.
